# 🌡️ ThermoTunes: Climate Data Turned Into Music

What if climate change could be heard instead of just seen? **ThermoTunes** transforms decades of global temperature data into emotionally resonant music.

## 🎵 What is ThermoTunes?
**ThermoTunes** is a generative AI project that sonifies climate change by:
- Mapping global temperature values to musical notes
- Designing chord progressions and rhythm patterns based on data
- Training an LSTM model to generate expressive MIDI sequences
- Enabling interactive visualization and playback through a Streamlit app


## 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Python** | **PyTorch** | **NumPy** | **scikit-learn**
- **MIDIUtil**, **Mido** – For MIDI generation
- **Streamlit** – For web UI & interaction


## 🚀 Run the Project
```bash
# Clone the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/yourusername/thermotunes.git
$ cd thermotunes

# Install dependencies
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

# Launch the Streamlit app
$ streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```
